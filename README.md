Unity 3D Rubik’s Cube 3-D combination puzzle as Birthday Gift for Julian Assange (July 03).

Caution 1/3: You have to be xtremely patient after klicking the "SOLVE" button for the 1st time - until 2 min have passed nothing will happen. Just stare at the cube or take a nap or eat a lollipop.
Caution 2/3: The center piece of the three finally visble states (blue, yellow, orange) often does not find its place, but randomly it does.
Caution 3/3: The "SOLVE" move also only occasionally snaps back to its initial state (meaning: some colored squared are misplaced).

Credits:
"SHUFFLE" Audio: milliseconds extract of Mos Def´s "The Embassy" (from his 4th Studio Album "The Ecstatic", 2009)
"SOLVE" Audio: milliseconds from Sergio Leone resp. Ennio Morricone "Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo" (1966) (L'estasi Dell'oro, Bandini Remix)

Disclaimer: The cube has huge hipster hickups (it`s from Iceland).
